# Other Companion Technologies

* OMDB API - I picked this because it is a free api that does not require a key. However, IMDB does not allow people to take their images so keep that in mind if you are trying to utilize OMDB for hosting an actual movie app
* Webpack - We use this to bundle our modules. When you run `npm start` you are actually starting the "webpack-dev-server" which will take care of everything for us. If you were to build your own full stack application you will need to build a `webpack.config.js` file and hook it up to your server. 
* ES6 - The newest version of JavaScript. Also known as `es2015`
* JSX - A preprocessor that allows us to write XML syntax inside of our JavaScript files. Since we are using a Virtual DOM JSX makes it look as close to writing HTML as possible.
* Axios - A promise based http client. Make XMLHttpRequests
* Babel - Transform our ES6 and JSX to JavaScript
* Node - A runtime environment for JavaScript.
